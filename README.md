# Monkey (Rusty edition)

This is a direct implementation of Thorsten Ball's Monkey language from the book
[Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/), ported to Rust as
I'm reading along. There's also another book where we write a compiler, but I'm
just going to get through the interpreter steps first.

Currently implemented:
 - [x] Parser
